# hh8-minor-project-2
Project Description
The DDoS Detection Tool is a cybersecurity tool programmed under Python, and it observes and checks live network traffic to pinpoint high-frequency packet flooding. It checks for potential DDoS attacks through the detection and monitoring of a specified number of packets sent by IP addresses within a fixed 10-second time period. Automatically, after detecting a potential threat, an IP is marked and included in a list of blacklisted IPs.
